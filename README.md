# go-api-friends
I've written this API during learning Golang. It's ordinary and simply rest-api without web interface. Structure - MVC. Used gin and mysql database. 

Allow user to set status and city. Control authorization using Json Web Token(gin-jwt)

Furthermore:
- [x] authorization
- [ ] unit-tests
- [ ] follow to see status
- [ ] refactor, probably...
